          <p>Based on our investigation, we think that we might have been exposed to the virus between <strong>February 19th and 21st</strong>. Only 3 days later, on 25th, we'll discover that one person we met during those days was positive, and all the other people were having COVID symptoms.</p>

          <p>As soon as we receive news that at least 1 person we got in touch with during the weekend tested positive, my wife goes pick up the kids from school and takes them directly to the testing facility our local hospital, with the support of Italian Army and Air Force, created to speed up the testing activities for children, students, and school personel. I am already feeling "dizzy", and <strong>while the kids are getting tested</strong>, contact our family doctor and <strong>book a swab test for my wife and I in a private clinic</strong>.</p>
          <p>In less than an hour we have a first result about the kids: <strong>the 8 years old is positive</strong> to the rapid test (and thus will receive a second RT-PCR test), while the younger is negative. That same afternoon, at 4 pm, my wife and I are tested. <strong>Our result will be available the following day</strong>.</p>

        <div class="timeline-event">
          <p>I already start feeling better. I don't have any fever, the blood pressure is ok, and the headache is tollerable. <strong>The only thing worrying me is O2 saturation</strong> that appears to be constantly under 95%. The morning begins with a phone call from the <strong>Local Health Authority</strong> (called ATS in Milan), which informs me that my son's second swap test confirmed his positivity to <strong>SARS-COV 2</strong>.</p>
          <p>The agent asks questions about him (when did his symptoms start -answer: never so far- why we tested him -answer: we know we got in touch with a person who's been tested positive) and about his school (which school does he attend, when was the last time he attended a class, etc.). She also asks where have we been after the exposure (gyms, sports, any extra-curricular activity). <strong>She tells us to try to keep the two kids as much separated as possible</strong>, since one is positive while the other negative, and I inform her that both my wife and I are waiting for the results of our tests, and that we already have mild symptoms. We agree that I'll call her as soon as we get the results, because having been tested in a private facility we'll be notified of the results before the ATS.</p>
          <p>We start organizing our home for a long stay: we split the kids, the youger is going to sleep an live (as much as possible) in our studio room, in order to keep him as much separated as possible from us. He's 5, but strong. We give him responsibility over our home office while we are sick, and he accepts it.</p>
          <p><strong>In the early afternoon we receive a confirmation of our positivity</strong> to <strong>Covid</strong>. As agreed, I call my agent at ATS back. Even if we talked few hours earlier, she asks me all the same questions she already asked about my kid, and does the same few minutes later, while talking to my wife. At the same time <strong>we contact our doctor that provides us prescriptions for few drugs and a plan for the next few days</strong>.</p>
          <p>Later in the afternoon, I'll forward to the ATS the lab results we received: we are now officially quarantined. The agent explains us that we are forbidden to leave our house, explains how to manage our waste, and asks if we need help with groceries.</p>

          <p><strong>First day with stomach ache</strong>. Nothing terrible, but I feel that something is not right. <strong>I also start coughing</strong>, even if very rarely. My cough doens't sound "dry" to me, it remembers the typical "smoker's" cough, I don't know how to describe it better. <strong>O2 saturation is getting better</strong>, today is always above 96%. <strong>The real news today is this incredible nervous mood</strong> that I feel. I am extremely irritable. And tired. Super tired.</p>
          <p>In the afternoon our G.P. calls to check on us: we inform him that we are stable, and he decides to not change anything of our therapy.</p>
          <p><strong>We receive a communication from the school, stating that the entire class is officially quarantined (my son's schoolmates and all their teachers) until March 11th</strong>. Lessons will be held online until further notice.</p>

          <p><strong>I start loosing the smell and taste</strong>. I can still feel something, but flavors are starting to fade out.</p>

We also check-in with the pediatrician: <strong>the kids are ok, bored as hell, but ok</strong>.</p>
          <p><strong>Reducing the quantity of cortisone improved my mood</strong> but I'm still extremely nervous.</p>

          <p><strong>I feel well and energic</strong>. I'd eat and entire grocery shop if I could. This morning I had the feeling of chocolate (I tried to taste a chocolate chip, and I felt it, not the flavour, but "something"). Then I started preparing the pizza for this evening: 3 large pizza pans and 1 large focaccia pugliese pan. Now I'm tired, but I did a lot of things. The kids are still well, we decided with the pediatrician to postpone their swab tests after both me and my wife will be negative. She looked a little bit better today compared to yesterday, but soon the day transformed into the worst so far, with a lot of pain in her joints During the afternoon we receive a call from a doctor of the "<strong>Covid 19 Task Force</strong>": she says that they'll check on us every couple of days to see how it goes. She also tells my wife that she's probably at the peak, and things will start getting better soon. We appreciate the call, but the timing (first call on day 8 since we've been diagnosed), makes me think that our Region (Lombardy) did really loose control of the pandemic.</p>

          <p><strong>I'm out</strong>. Tired, yes, unable to feel flavours or smells, yes. But ok. I just feel a little bit short-breathed, but ok. O2 saturation is in line with expectations (I can't reach 99%, but I am always above 96%) so it's ok. I'm reducing the doses cortisone and ketoprofen.</p>
          <p>In the morning my wife looks a little bit better compared to yesterday evening, she also tries the "5 minutes walk test". Let's see how it evolves.</p>
          <p>Today a squad from the USCA (Unità Speciali di Continuità Assistenziale - Home Assistance Special Units) will visit my dad and his caregiver to perform a swab test on them. I visited them for very few minutes on February 23rd, but the ATS decided that they deserved test on the 10th day after the exposure. My dad is quadriplegic, needs constant assistance and cannot leave his house, so the Local Health Authority managed to have them tested at home.</p>
